Lab 1: Infrastructure Foundations for NGINX for Azure
Overview
Welcome to App World 2026. This lab is a core component of the session:
"Mastering cloud-native app delivery: Unlocking advanced capabilities and use cases with F5’s ADCaaS."

In this module, you will establish the core networking and identity foundations required to deploy NGINXaaS (NGINX for Azure). To ensure we maximize our time during the workshop, the base networking layer is treated as a pre-provisioned foundation, allowing us to focus on the advanced configuration and integration of F5's ADCaaS solutions.
